Pyber Analysis

Overview of the Pyber Analysis
The purpose of this exercise is to create a comprehensive analysis based on the information provided by Pyber. This analysis required the use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to summarize and visualize the data that was provided. 

Analysis Results:
1.	Rural cities have the least number of drivers, rides, and fares. 
2.	Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides, and fares.
3.	Suburban cities are in the middle pertaining to the metrics that were previously mentioned. 
4.	Rural cities have the least number of drivers, rides, and fares; however, the total amount of fares was higher on average when comparing the three city types. This can be due to several factors including the length of the distances between destination points. The inverse can be said about the Urban cities. While Urban cities tend to have more drivers, fares, and rides; the average fare was generally lower than the Rural fares. 
 
Summary:
The data that was provided for this analysis was comprehensive. As previously stated in the findings, it was discovered that the Rural areas while having the lowest amount of overhead ultimately yielded the highest fares. This can be due to several factors such as fewer competing drivers and the longer distances that the drivers need to cover. The following recommendations should aid the company in increasing its revenue stream:
•	Increase the charge per mile for shorter trips specifically in the suburban and urban cities. 
•	Implement demand pricing specifically in suburban and urban cities. 
•	Change the type of cars in each city type; for example, use electric vehicles in urban and suburban areas to reduce the overhead incurred by the drivers. For Rural areas use hybrid electric vehicles that have greater range than the electric vehicles for the longer distances.
